# Pong 
Pong remake based on Colten Ogden's tutorial c/o cs50 @harvard using love2d and lua

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfwpRU0cT10) if you'd like to make your own version of the game.

To run the game, install the [love2d](http://love2d.org/) engine. 

## Current status
The game is not quite complete. Ball movement, paddle collisions and basic game play works, but still need to implement scoring and win conditions.
